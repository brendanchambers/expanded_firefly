1. firefly_dynamics

3. plotting helper function

UPDATING
Decided not to keep a 'master' copy of firefly_dynamics/update_firefly_population
                                nor network_simulator_and_scorer
                              to keep customization easy

UPDATING
No master shared copy but currently a shared copy across the lognormal and search-range project directories
Going to need different versions for the clustering and criticality projects though
